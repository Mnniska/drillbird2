<p>
During my two years at Tarsier Studios I worked as a Level designer creating levels for critically acclaimed Little Nightmares 2, using Unreal Engine 4. 
I designed puzzles, platforming sections and stealth scenarios. I also worked closely with Blueprints - implementing, polishing and bugfixing hand crafted puzzle interactions as well as scripting the game's many AI encounters.

	Drillbird is a ~1-5h digging platformer where you play as a bird with a drill as its beak, drilling your way through the world to find ores in order to make your egg hatch.  

	I developed the game over three months after the studio I previously worked at shut down. I think it's a good testament to my game design, 
	programming and planning skills.

<p>
Frog Climbers started out as a Student Project for one of our game creation courses. After recieving a lot of positive feedback, such as winning the Game Design award at the student game development competition Swedish Game Awards, we decided to flesh out the initial prototype and release the game commercially. 
We managed to secure Dear Villagers as a distributor and released the game on Steam in 2016. 
</p>

<p>
The game is no longer availale on Steam as we decided to close down the company we released it with - but there's a lot of videos showcasing the game.

		<h3>LittleBigPlanet Vita </h3>
		<i>2012</i>
		<br>
		<img src="images/banner_LBPV.jpg" alt="Littlebigplanet vita header image" width="600">
		<p>
		<ul>
<li>		<b>Platforms:</b> Playstation Vita
<li>		<b>Team:</b> Tarsier Studios - about ~20 people
<li>		<b>Publisher:</b> SONY Entertainment
<li>		<b>Genre:</b> Platformer
<li>		<b>Role:</b> Junior Level Designer
<li>		<a href=”https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LittleBigPlanet_PS_Vita”>Wikipedia page</a>
		</ul>
		</p>
		
<p>
I started out making games in 2008 making levels for LittleBigPlanet for fun. At the tender age of 16, in 2011 I was hired over a summer by Tarsier Studios to create levels and minigames for LittleBigPlanet Vita. 
This gig convinced me that game development was a valid career choice - I have been making games ever since.
</p>

<p>
As a level designer, I designed multiple minigames for the game such as <a href="https://youtu.be/khHkoLjDxzI?t=19">this tetris-esque game</a>, as well as <a href="https://youtu.be/khHkoLjDxzI?t=272">this boxing game.</a>
</p>

<p>
Aside from my time at Tarsier, I was a very active LittleBigPlanet level designer from 2008 - 2014, creating levels for fun. This is where I picked up the majority of my level design skills. 
</p>
<p>
For example, I created <br>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERdeYnxbFOs">Help Yourself</a> -  A puzzle platformer focusing on a cloning gimmick. This level was accompanied by a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Lm_rT48YSg">youtube series</a> where I documented the creation process of the level. 
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTJQbKa1v28">Flowerbucket</a> - A storydriven puzzle platformer where I dealt with my first breakup.
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-pwFUJs3Qw">My Little Pony: Racing is magic</a> - A My Little Pony tribute racing game
