<p>
	Drillbird is a ~1-5h digging platformer where you play as a bird with a drill as its beak, drilling your way through the world to find ores in order to make your egg hatch.  
</p>
<p>

	I developed the game over three months after the studio I previously worked at shut down. It's a good testament to my game design, planning and programming skills. 
	
</p>

<h3>Responsibilities</h3>
<p> 
<ul>
  <li>Designed the game, from all of the rules driving the game design, to the hand crafted world.</li>
  <li>Coded the entire game using Godots GDScript. </li>
  <li>Planned the projects scope to ensure it could be delivered within the narrow 4 month window. 
  <li>Drew some of the art - including the characters, UI, and a first pass for environments and cutscenes. </li>
<li>Headed the project, providing guidance and hype for Drillbirds other contributors </li>
</ul>


<h3>Deeper breakdowns</h2>
<p>
I will be posting more analysis and breakdowns of how I approached the design of Drillbird in the coming weeks - starting with a talk about
the approach and methods I used to finish the game within four months. However, at the time of writing here's what I've got:
