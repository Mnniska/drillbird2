</ul>

Below, you'll find some video examples of my work in Little Nightmares 2 - although of course all of the levels were touched by many hands to reach the final quality bar. 

<h4>AI encounters</h4>

As a level designer I had the pleasure of working closely with our AI programmers and Animator to implement and polish the game's various enemy AI encounters - scripting both the enemy AIs and the AI companion. 
The timestamp in the video above features a distraction puzzle in order to secure a Fuse as well as a chase with the Doctor. 
<br><br>
I level designed, scripted and polished this area, from exiting the stairs to riding the elevator up. 



<h4>Custom-built level interactions</h4>

I designed and implemented multiple puzzles featured in the final game. Little Nightmares 2 is a game where the puzzles and platforming act as breathing room between the intensive stealth and chase sections. This meant they ideally did not stump the player, while still inducing "aha!" moments.
At the same time, we went to great lengths to make each puzzle feel like an unique interaction wirthin the world - often requiring custom Blueprint solutions to make them work. 
<br><br>
In the above video the player encounters a Piano - which can be wound up and crashed through the floor. 
The piano is later played by the player's AI companion in order to distract an enemy, allowing the player to kill it. 
<br><br>

I was responsible for designing this room as well as setting up this interaction using Unreals Blueprint system. 
 This involved level logic to ensure the piano looks
and behaves convincingly, AI scripting to make Six and the enemy behave correctly, and blueprinting  to make the piano play the correct keys when walked upon as well as ensuring the piano is correctly loaded and saved depending on the savestate. 
<br>

<h4>Platforming Sections</h4>

I also had the pleasure of designing some of the traversal sections in the game. In the section above - I was responsible for designing an easy to solve traversal puzzle. 
<br><br>
The puzzle isn't revolutionary - but it gives the player a break before building up the tension for the next section of the game. It also highlights the friendship between the two main characters. 
<br><br>
I level designed this puzzle, coming up with and implementing the TV pushing interaction for the player and their companion. I also scripted the AI to behave convincingly using a combination of Tarsiers AI system and Unreal blueprints.
