<h3>Responsibilities</h3>

<h4>Puzzle Design and Scripting</h4>
I designed multiple puzzles featured in the final game. Little Nightmares 2 is a game where the puzzles and platforming act as breathing room between the intensive stealth and chase sections. This meant they had to be solved with relative ease. At the same time,
we went to great lengths to make each puzzle feel like an unique interaction wirthin the world - often requiring custom Blueprint solutions to make them work. 

<br><br>
For example - in one part of the game the player encounters a 
Piano - which can be wound up and crashed through the floor. The piano is later used to distract an enemy, allowing the player to kill it. <a href="https://youtu.be/QFRCDgjblis?t=1794">Here is a video</a> featuring the interaction. 

<br><br>
I was responsible for setting up this interaction using Unreals Blueprint system. This involves a lot of level logic to ensure the piano looks
and behaves convincingly, AI scripting to ensure Six and the enemy behave correctly, and blueprinting skills to make the piano play the correct keys when walked upon as well as ensuring the piano is correctly loaded and saved depending on the savestate.
